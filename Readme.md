Concept Behind Reptor: Templating vs. Scripting in Report Generation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to generating data-driven reports, there are fundamentally two approaches: scripting and templating.

### Scripting

Scripting involves writing custom code to handle data and format the report. It offers flexibility but requires extensive programming, making it complex and time-consuming for users without coding expertise.

### Templating

In contrast, templating, the approach chosen for Reptor, allows users to define report layouts and formatting directly within a familiar interface - an Excel file. This method is intuitive and user-friendly, significantly reducing the learning curve.

#### Why Templating with Excel?

1.  **Familiarity**: Excel is a widely-used tool with a familiar interface for many users, making it an ideal platform for designing report templates.
2.  **Flexibility**: Excel's native functionalities (like cells, formulas, and formatting options) offer significant flexibility in defining how data should be presented.
3.  **Efficiency**: By using Excel for templating, users can rapidly prototype and modify report designs without needing to delve into complex programming.
4.  **Dynamic Reports**: With Excel, we can create dynamic templates that automatically adjust and populate with data, offering a powerful way to generate customized reports.

Through Reptor, we bring the best of both worlds: the ease of templating through Excel and the power of PHP for processing and generating sophisticated reports.

### Advanced Cell and Row Styling with Excel Templates

One of the most significant advantages of using Excel templates in Reptor is the extensive styling capabilities it offers:

1.  **Cell Styling**: Users can leverage Excel's rich cell formatting options to define the appearance of individual cells. This includes font styles, colors, borders, and background fills, allowing for highly customized reports that are visually appealing and easy to read.

2.  **Row and Column Formatting**: Beyond single cells, Reptor allows for the styling of entire rows and columns. This feature is crucial for maintaining consistency and clarity in reports, especially when dealing with large datasets.

3.  **Conditional Formatting**: Excel's conditional formatting can be used to dynamically style cells based on the data they contain. This brings an added layer of interactivity to your reports, enabling users to quickly identify trends, anomalies, or key metrics at a glance.

4.  **Ease of Use**: By harnessing the familiar interface of Excel, users can style their reports without any additional learning curve, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.


Through Reptor, these styling capabilities are seamlessly integrated into the report generation process, ensuring that the final output is not only informative but also aesthetically pleasing and tailored to specific presentation needs.

### Utilizing Expression Language in Excel Cells

Reptor harnesses the power of Symfony Expression Language to enhance the dynamism of Excel templates:

1.  **Expression Language in Cells**: Users can embed expressions directly into Excel cells. These expressions, based on Symfony's robust framework, can manipulate and present data dynamically, adding significant functionality to your reports.

2.  **Variable and Object Integration**: A variety of user-defined or predefined objects and variables can be used within these expressions. These can be defined directly in the Excel document's custom properties or via an initializing boot script or in any pre-processing phase of the report generation.

3.  **Adaptors and Data Sources**: Reptor supports various data sources through its adaptable interface, including PDO, Socket, Array, and more, as seen in the `Reptor/Adaptor/Datasource` namespace. This flexibility allows for the integration of diverse data sets.

4.  **Uniform Connection Strings**: Data sources are connected using a uniform connection string, akin to Java or PHP DSN, simplifying the process of linking to and utilizing different datasets.


Through these features, Reptor allows for extensive customization and dynamic data processing, enabling users to create highly sophisticated and tailored reports directly from Excel.

Philosophy of Rendering: The Concept of Excel-Based Templating
--------------------------------------------------------------

Reptor introduces a unique approach to processing Excel templates, centered around the concept of 'Units':

1.  **Units - The Core of Templating**: In Reptor, 'Units' are the basic units of expressions that belong together, crucial for understanding how expressions within the same row of a dataset interact.

2.  **Defining Units with Named Ranges**: Users define these 'Units' using named ranges in Excel. This method organizes the template and prepares it for processing.

3.  **Sequential Processing and Evaluation**: The template processing involves sequentially evaluating these Units. During this phase, evaluated expressions transform into objects.

4.  **Priority and Types of Units**: Each object has a type, and these types have inherent priorities. The priority of an object determines the type of its corresponding Unit in the evaluation process.

5.  **Rendering Logic Driven by Unit Types**: Once Units are classified, the rendering logic takes over, driven by the type of each Unit. This step ensures that the final output aligns with the intended structure and format of the template.

### Understanding Units in Excel Templates

In the Reptor system, a 'Unit' encapsulates a collection of expressions that are logically related and processed together to produce a cohesive section of the report. 

![img-2.png](docs/img-2.png)

Here's how it works:

*  **Binding Expressions**: As demonstrated in the provided figure, expressions are bound within named ranges in Excel, forming a 'Unit'. This ensures that data belonging to the same conceptual group is processed in unison.

* **Named Ranges**: The use of named ranges such as `unit_partner_group` helps identify and process these Units efficiently, keeping the related expressions tied together.

*   **Multiple Units Handling**: Users can define multiple Units within an Excel template, each representing a different section of the report or different data groupings.

*   **Sequential Processing**: Reptor iterates through these Units sequentially and processes their cells until reaches last one. After that emits event with the instruction of dataset iterators can fetch the next data row (if has). So the processing continues row by row this way, as long as there are remaining referred dataset rows in any units.

* **Expression Syntax**: The syntax `{{activity.GroupBy('partner')}}` within the cells is evaluated against the referred object provided to Reptor. This allows for dynamic content generation based on the data.
