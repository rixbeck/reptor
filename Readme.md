# Reptor
## PhpSpreadsheet based report generator


The PHPSpreadsheet Report Generator is a PHP-orientated solution curated to empower users to generate reports seamlessly. Embedded with the prevailing attributes of the PHP 8.1 enabled PHPSpreadsheet library, this project ensures the generation of dynamic XLSX reports using Excel-based template files.

Facilitating the inclusion of data sources or datasets makes it a versatile tool for diverse reporting needs.

Whether you are an individual aiming for personal data understanding or an enterprise seeking to streamline complex data analysis, the PHPSpreadsheet Report Generator serves to be an invaluable tool to garner insights, make strategic decisions or simply comprehend an array of information.

The project was highly inspired by [alhimik1986](https://github.com/alhimik1986) and his [PHP Excel Templator](https://github.com/alhimik1986/php-excel-templator) library.
